# Design Patterns in Software Engineering

Welcome to the **Design Patterns** documentation!  
This guide covers the most widely used patterns in software development, with real-world examples and explanations.

## 🔍 What Are Design Patterns?

**Design patterns** are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices refined by experienced developers over time.

---

## 📦 Pattern Categories

Design patterns are typically divided into three main categories:

### 1. Creational Patterns
> These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms.

- [Singleton](creational/singleton.md)
- [Factory Method](creational/factory-method.md)
- [Abstract Factory](creational/abstract-factory.md)
- [Builder](creational/builder.md)
- [Prototype](creational/prototype.md)

---

### 2. Structural Patterns
> These patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed.

- [Adapter](structural/adapter.md)
- [Bridge](structural/bridge.md)
- [Composite](structural/composite.md)
- [Decorator](structural/decorator.md)
- [Facade](structural/facade.md)
- [Flyweight](structural/flyweight.md)
- [Proxy](structural/proxy.md)

---

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
> These patterns manage object interactions and responsibilities.

- [Chain of Responsibility](behavioral/chain-of-responsibility.md)
- [Command](behavioral/command.md)
- [Interpreter](behavioral/interpreter.md)
- [Iterator](behavioral/iterator.md)
- [Mediator](behavioral/mediator.md)
- [Memento](behavioral/memento.md)
- [Observer](behavioral/observer.md)
- [State](behavioral/state.md)
- [Strategy](behavioral/strategy.md)
- [Template Method](behavioral/template-method.md)
- [Visitor](behavioral/visitor.md)
